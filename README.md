### Something to say

- Since this is my first "real" markdown README file, I will discuss my work throughout this project

## Project

### CSS

- Background Property: HTML/CSS alway weird, when i set the "slides" div with this code, it didn't work

```css
background: url(../background/BayernMunchen.jpg) no-repeat center center/cover;
```

- So I realize the fact that I set the `background: ...` to the HTML which is **inline style**
- So the background itself is a shorthand, so it overwrite the default anything I showed above

```css
background-repeat, background-position, background-size
```

> So I set background property to !important

### JavaScript

- I learned the new thing that you can set all the background slide to `opacity: 0` along with the class 'active' with `opacity: 1`, so you can manipulate that with JavaScript Array
